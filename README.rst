IRK
===

A dumb little IRC client.


Installation
------------

Clone the project somewhere, say into ``~/irk``, then 
do a ``pip install ~/irk``. Or better: install it into
a virtual environment.


Usage
-----

To run it, type into a terminal ``irk HOST[:PORT]``, for instance 
``irk irc.freenode.net``.

Once connected, type basic IRC commands (they don't need to be
uppercase), like::

    join #music-trivia

To quit type ``quit``.


Help
----

In a terminal, type ``irk --help``.
